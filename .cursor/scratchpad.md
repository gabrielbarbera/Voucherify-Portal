## Executor's Feedback / Assistance Requests

_No blockers at the moment_

## Lessons

- Always use PowerShell syntax for commands (PowerShell is the default shell)
- Project uses Vite as build tool
- **No external API keys needed** - Application is purely client-side using localStorage
- Dependencies are already installed and up to date
- **Fixed Internal Server Error**: Removed importmap from index.html that was causing conflicts. Vite handles module resolution automatically, so the importmap was unnecessary.

## Notes

- Project uses React Router DOM for routing
- HashRouter is configured for client-side routing
- Portal includes dashboard, voucher creation, and demo store functionality
